# data-analysis
**Preview 0.1**

The goal of this project is to learn the basics of pandas and matplotlib libraries 
and create cool charts while drawing a conclusion from the analysis of the dataset.

For now the only analysis in this repo is based on a dataset of coffee bean ratings
of the Coffee Quality Institute. 

To run this project you need Python 3.10 installed. Also, please check the 
requirements.txt to install the necessary Python libraries.

After cloning the repo and installing the libraries you can open the Jupyter
Notebook - which contains both the code and the created charts along with their 
explanations - by typing the command ```jupyter notebook``` in a terminal and
navigating to the ```coffee-analysis.ipynb``` file.
